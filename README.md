👋 Hi, I’m Adiyti Suman

Backend Engineer | Cloud-Native Systems | MLOps & Data Platforms

🚀 About Me

I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Computer Science, specializing in distributed backend systems, cloud-native architecture, and production MLOps pipelines.

My core strength lies in building scalable APIs, event-driven systems, and data platforms, and taking ML models from experimentation to reliable production. I enjoy working close to infrastructure — optimizing performance, reliability, observability, and deployment workflows.

I think in terms of systems, failure modes, and long-term scalability.
